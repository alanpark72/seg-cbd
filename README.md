# Seg CBD
Segmenting CBDs with Deep Neural Networks

## Note
* This Repository implemented a function to segment the CBD region in CT images as part of a project to develop a diagnostic tool for cholangiopathy(biliary stones) using DNN.
* ResUnet and ResUnet++ models can be used for inference.
* **This project does not provide datasets by the Personal Information Protection Act.**
* Use as evidence of a dissertation or medical diagnosis is prohibited.
